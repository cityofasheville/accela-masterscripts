<p>Hello ' + ????????? + ', </p>
<p>The City of Asheville\'s Water Resources Department has received the residential Water Availability application for permit number ' + capIDString + ' </p>
<p>
Next, a Water Resources Department technician will verify the proposed location for the new tap/meter or condition of the existing tap/meter. Please follow the instructions below to clearly and visibly mark the proposed or existing tap/meter location on your property. 
</p>
<p>
Mark the tap/meter location using a 3-foot blue stake flag labeled in permanent marker with the site address, contact name and phone number. If needed, blue flags are available for pick up during business hours at the Development Services Department (DSD) at 161 S. Charlotte Street. 
</p>

<li>
<u>New Tap/Meter:</u> Place the blue flag 5 feet from the edge of the roadway; do not place the flag in a present or future driveway and/or walkway. 
</li>
<li>
<u>Existing Tap/Meter:</u>  Place the blue flag next to the correct meter box. Be sure that the meter box is accessible and clear of dirt and/or debris.
