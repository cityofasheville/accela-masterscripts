# General Accela Scripting Gotchas
* Must use `==` rather than `===` because Accela does not return types consistently

# Needs Investigation
* Must have semicolon at the end of every line?
* `==` works and `!=` doesn’t?
* Switch statements don’t work?
* aa.sendMail rather than email? (goes through Communication Manager)
* See ConvertToRealCapAfter
